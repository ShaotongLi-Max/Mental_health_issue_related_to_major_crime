The original raw data is too large to upload to github.
However, if you run "01-download_data.R", it will download two raw data stored here named as "raw_data_mci.csv" and "raw_data_mha.csv".
The link to both raw data are :
raw_data_mci.csv: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/major-crime-indicators/
raw_data_mha.csv: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/mental-health-apprehensions/
